## Design Approach: Modern Minimalist with Professional Depth

**Design Movement:** Contemporary Corporate Minimalism with Data-Driven Aesthetics

**Core Principles:**
1. **Clean Information Hierarchy** - Clear visual separation between status indicators, actions, and data tables
2. **Subtle Depth** - Soft shadows and layered cards create visual structure without clutter
3. **Functional Color Coding** - Strategic use of semantic colors (green for success, red for errors) with muted neutral backgrounds
4. **Purposeful Whitespace** - Generous padding and spacing that guides the eye through the interface

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Primary Palette:** Deep slate gray (#1e293b) for text, crisp white backgrounds, and soft gray accents (#f1f5f9)
- **Semantic Colors:** Emerald green (#10b981) for success states, rose red (#e11d48) for errors, amber (#f59e0b) for warnings
- **Reasoning:** Professional yet approachable; the muted grays create a calm, focused environment while semantic colors provide immediate status recognition
- **Emotional Intent:** Trustworthy, efficient, and data-focused

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Vertical flow with clear sections: Header → Status Card → Action Button → Data Table
- Status card positioned prominently with icon and text alignment
- Table uses alternating row backgrounds for readability
- Ample vertical spacing between sections (48px) to create breathing room

**Signature Elements:**
1. **Status Badge System** - Circular indicator dots with status labels (Connected/Disconnected/Error)
2. **Gradient Accent Line** - Subtle top border on cards using primary color
3. **Data Table with Expandable Rows** - Hover effects and expandable error details for failed batches

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Hover states on buttons and table rows provide tactile feedback
- Button click triggers loading state with spinner animation
- Smooth transitions between loading and result states
- Expandable rows reveal additional error details without page navigation

**Animation:**
- Button: Subtle scale (1 → 1.02) on hover, fade-in spinner during loading
- Table rows: Gentle background color transition on hover (50ms)
- Status badge: Pulse animation for "processing" state
- Transitions: 200ms ease-in-out for all interactive elements

**Typography System:**
- **Display Font:** 'Geist' or 'Sohne' (modern sans-serif) for headers - bold weight (700)
- **Body Font:** 'Inter' (neutral, highly readable) for content - regular (400) and medium (500)
- **Hierarchy:** 
  - H1: 32px, 700 weight (main title)
  - H2: 24px, 600 weight (section headers)
  - Body: 14px, 400 weight (table content)
  - Label: 12px, 500 weight (uppercase, table headers)
